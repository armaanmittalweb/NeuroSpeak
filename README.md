## Overview

NeuroSpeak is a state-of-the-art AI system that converts EEG (electroencephalogram) signals into natural speech. Using a 3-stage pipelined deep learning architecture with RNNs and Transformer decoders, NeuroSpeak bridges the gap between neural activity and verbal communication, potentially offering a communication channel for individuals with speech impairments.

## Key Features

- **EEG Signal Processing**: Advanced preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and extracting features from raw EEG data
- **3-Stage Deep Learning Pipeline**: Sequential neural processing for optimal signal-to-speech conversion
- **RNN + Transformer Architecture**: Combines temporal processing with attention mechanisms
- **Optimized Performance**: 40% reduction in inference time through model quantization and parallel processing
- **Natural Language Generation**: High-quality speech synthesis from processed brain signals

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](assets/images/architecture_diagram.png)

NeuroSpeak processes EEG signals through a 3-stage pipeline:

1. **Signal Preprocessing**: Filtering, artifact removal, and feature extraction from raw EEG data
2. **Neural Encoding**: RNN-based processing to capture temporal patterns in brain activity
3. **Speech Synthesis**: Transformer decoder that converts encoded neural patterns into natural speech

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuroSpeak.git
cd NeuroSpeak

# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install optional development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from neurospeak import NeuroSpeakModel, EEGProcessor

# Initialize the EEG processor
eeg_processor = EEGProcessor(sampling_rate=256, channels=64)

# Load pretrained model
model = NeuroSpeakModel.from_pretrained('models/neurospeak_v1.0')

# Process EEG data and generate speech
eeg_data = eeg_processor.load_data('path/to/eeg_recording.edf')
processed_signal = eeg_processor.preprocess(eeg_data)
speech_output = model.generate_speech(processed_signal)

# Save the generated speech
speech_output.save_to_file('output_speech.wav')
```

## Dataset

NeuroSpeak was trained and evaluated on multiple EEG datasets:

- **[EEG-Speech Dataset](https://github.com/yourusername/eeg-speech-dataset)**: Our custom dataset containing paired EEG and speech recordings
- **[Temple University EEG Corpus](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/)**: Used for additional training and validation

See the [data documentation](docs/data.md) for more information on how to prepare and use these datasets.

## Training

To train your own NeuroSpeak model:

```bash
# Basic training with default parameters
python -m neurospeak.train --data-dir /path/to/dataset --output-dir ./trained_model

# Advanced training with custom configuration
python -m neurospeak.train --config configs/advanced_training.yaml
```

For detailed training instructions, hyperparameter tuning, and transfer learning options, see the [training documentation](docs/training.md).

## Evaluation

Evaluate model performance with the built-in evaluation script:

```bash
python -m neurospeak.evaluate --model-path ./trained_model --test-data /path/to/test_data
```

## Optimization

NeuroSpeak includes several optimization techniques:

- Model quantization (INT8)
- Parallel processing across CPU cores
- GPU acceleration
- ONNX Runtime integration

These optimizations result in a 40% reduction in inference time without sacrificing accuracy. See the [optimization guide](docs/optimization.md) for details.
